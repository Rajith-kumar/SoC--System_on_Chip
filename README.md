# Confidential SoC Development (Public Summary)

## 📌 Overview
This repository provides a **professional, high-level description** of a custom System-on-Chip (SoC) project developed during a research internship at IIT Patna. All sensitive code and proprietary design details are excluded, but the summary showcases the scope, technical depth, and innovation behind the work — useful for potential collaborators and recruiters.

---

## ⚙️ SoC Architecture (Public Summary)
- **Core**: Custom-designed pipelined RISC-V-based processor with extendable ISA for application-specific acceleration.
- **Peripherals**: UART, SPI, Timers, GPIO, SPI Flash Loader.
- **Bus Architecture**: APB3-based integration for modular IP communication.
- **Memory**: On-chip Block RAM and external SPI Flash for program storage and loading.
- **Target Platform**: Artix-7 FPGA for prototyping.

---

## 📈 Key Contributions
- Led the **entire RTL design cycle**: ISA definition → assembler creation → processor pipeline → peripheral integration.
- Developed an **assembler in C** to support the extended ISA.
- Integrated Xilinx and custom IP blocks seamlessly over the APB3 bus.
- Verified the complete SoC on FPGA using testbenches and real-world workloads.
- Selected for integration as a **co-processor** in a 5-year AI/ML-based forest monitoring project.

## 🔒 Confidentiality
- All Verilog source files, low-level schematics, and proprietary configurations remain private.
- Only non-sensitive block diagrams and architectural overviews are provided.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **HDL**: Verilog
- **Tools**: Xilinx Vivado, ModelSim, Git, Python, C
- **Platform**: Artix-7 FPGA
